        <h3>Why am I here ???</h3>

        <p> As a failed Sound Engineer and Sound Designer , I had to re think life and what to do with it. One day an advert pop up on my instagram about Coding Bootcamp,
             I had no idea what a boot camp was and no idea about coding. It caught my attention, so after searching for more information about it. 
             And seeing that many people have managed to change the career with it . I showed my interest in it, I did the 3 week python software dev course as a teaser. 
             And I liked it. So now Im here trying my best to learn and become a software engineer and chage my career finally </p>
